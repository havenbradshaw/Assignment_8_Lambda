# Assignment_8_Lambda

Using the '.stream' and various methods I utilized alongside it, there were a couple of notable improvements. The most major is the readibility and concisness. The code went from nested loops and various variables used specifically for each method, to basically one line of code for each method with a direct return statement. The structure is significantly more simple. 

I did also notice a small improvement in the speed of the output for the program between the 'LegacyRoster' and the 'LegacyRosterLambda'.

With the usage of the lambda and '.stream' with the related functions, the program is now much more maintainable. Someone with less experience with this system will have a much easier time updating and maintaining this code than before. Altering the code is more intuitive.

Comment 1:
All legacy for-loops have been replaced with stream operations, improving clarity and maintainability. Sorting logic is correct and uses comparators appropriately for multi-field sorting. Overall
